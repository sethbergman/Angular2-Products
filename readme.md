### Install dependencies
```
npm install
```
This installs the dependencies as defined in the package.json file.

### Start the application
```
npm start
```
This launches the TypeScript compiler (tsc) to compile the application and wait for changes. It also starts the lite-server and launches the browser to run the application.
